				<h2>Neeman's</h2>
				<h5>Founders: Amar Preet Singh and Taran Chhabra</h5>
				<h5>Funding Received: $9.8 million</h5>
				<p>This Hyderabad-based startup that creates men's shoes from Merino sheep wool is less well-known but no less intriguing. You must be wondering why this is so unique at this point. Let us explain. Only in the extremely cold climates of New Zealand and Australia can this particular breed of sheep survive. We won't get into the specifics, but it took the Neeman's founders roughly 22 months to design, produce, and introduce the first lines of shoes in India. It is not surprising that this shoe-making business is succeeding in Hyderabad's startup scene.</p>

				<h2>Skinkraft</h2>
				<h5>Founders:  Chaitanya Nallan, Veerendra Shivhare, and Sangram Simha</h5>
				<h5>Funding Received: NA</h5>
				<p>Because every skin type is unique, so too should the skincare products used on it. Purchasing any face wash or cream at random from the grocery store could end up damaging your skin more than helping it. This new business in Hyderabad sells customised skincare kits for as little as Rs 999. If you feel that it is excessive, keep in mind that they have spent more than 10,000 hours researching the best ingredients for your skin. Each of their products incorporates the knowledge of dermatologists from India, Taiwan, and Japan, giving them a stellar reputation among startup businesses in Hyderabad.</p>
